# ***Rock, Paper, Scissors Game***
## **Goal**
- The main goal for this project is to practice programming using JavaScript. I will create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game that is to be played through the browser console. No GUI will be created but will be implemented at a later time.

## Image Use
- All clipart images are being used freely from clip-artlibrary.com
## **Current skills to work on**
- Basic programming with JavaScript
---
### *Side Note to Review Learning*
- 3 ways to include JavaScript in a page:
  - Use a \<script> tag within the HTML document
  - Use an external script with *\<script src="[fileName].js"\>\</script>* placed in the HTML document
  - Inline code using attributes and values
---
## Time Taken: 1 Hour
---
## Future additions:
  - input validator
  - GUI
  - options to keep playing
