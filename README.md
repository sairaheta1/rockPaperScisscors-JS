# **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**
## **Goal**
- The main goal for this project is to practice programming using JavaScript while improving my Web Design skills. I utilized a new JavaScript library, SweetAlert, and heavily focused on a Flex layout for the CSS design. I initially started the game with no UI, solely playing through the console with window prompts for user input and console statements for results. I was then able to create a simple UI for the game and incorporated DOM manipulation to my JavaScript.

## **Image Use**
- All clipart images are being used freely from [clip-artlibrary.com](http://clipart-library.com/)

## **Library Use**
- To display pop-up messages once the game has ended, I utilized the SweetAlert library found [here](https://sweetalert.js.org).

## **Color Palette Use**
- I generated a custom color palette using the Coolors generator found [here](https://coolors.co).
